#### Xmas is null pcap reader(XINPR)
XINPR is null is a small program written in c used for extracting Xmas and Null
scan packets from a pcap file. This was a triump. This project was made for the
good of all of us except the ones who are dead.  It has a limited use case
since it was only meant as a learning experience on how to work with network
traffic and parse it. 

## Functionalities 
The program can be used to read certain types of pcap files(see Support). It
only requires a pcap file as a single argument and it should print out all the
Xmas and Null scan packets in the file using the following format: 

<source Mac address> <destination Mac address> <ether type> [<bad_csum>] <source IP>
<destination IP> <IP header protocol field> [<bad_csum>] <source port>
<destination port> <type>

The first bad checksum shows that the IP packet header checksum was bad. The
second is for the tcp header checksum. The last field shows the type of the
field which is either Xmas or Null. If we hit a bad_csum the rest of the row is 
not printed

## Example use 
Bellow we can see an example output of xinpr. I shortened it a bit because it
was too long but you get the idea.

$ xinpr foo.pcap

## Install
To compile from source you need to run the following commands:
./configure
make
make install

The configure script does not have any special options for the project. Only the standart ones 
that are always supported. For a more in depth explanation read the INSTALL file.

You can also build a deb file if you desire using debuild and install it with dpkg -i <deb file>

## Support
XINPR supports only pcap files that have packets only for ethernet networks and only the IP and TCP
protocols are used. This is because I wrote the program as part of the GNU System course at Sofia
Univercity St. Kliment Ohridski.

## Error codes
1) input error 2) open file error 3) read error 4) ip header under 20 bytes 5) tcp header under 20 bytes
